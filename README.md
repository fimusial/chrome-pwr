**PWRToy** is an extension comprising a collection of vanilla JS scripts which provide your browser with custom features. It utilizes only native Manifest V3 APIs and ships with no third-party code.

## Features
#### Audio
- **Recording** - PWRToy provides a simple way to record audio from one of the browser's tabs. Toggle recording on or off with a single button click and save it in `.wav` format.
- **Visualizers & Filters** - When capturing audio from a tab, three live visualizers are available - a moving spectrogram, a jumping volume bar chart and a waveform graph. They can be opened in a pop-out window and cycled through with a click. The extension also offers a high-pass and a low-pass filter, which you can control with two sliders to cut out unwanted frequencies from the sound.
- **Volume Duck** - Have you ever encountered a website, which played annoyingly loud sounds with no way of turning them down, forcing you to lower the volume in your device's settings? PWRToy has got you covered! Use the Volume Duck feature to configure a volume multiplier for each pesky website.

#### Mouse Macros
This feature allows you to record a sequence of mouse clicks on a website and play it back - either once or in a loop. Keyboard shortcuts can be configured to trigger macro playback conveniently. Both the recording and the playback will be maintained across page loads within the same website.

#### Miscellaneous features
- **Maxscroll** - This one enables you to quickly traverse a page with lazily loaded content by forcing it to constantly scroll up or down as fast as possible.
- **Page CSS** - The extension injects any user-provided CSS into a webpage each time it loads, applying the styles across the entire domain. This can be used to hide unwanted elements or to customize the website's design.
- **Content Edit** - This feature provides a quick way to edit any text on a page without using the developer tools. Simply click the "Content Edit On" button, place your cursor at the desired text location and start typing. Essentially, it activates the `contenteditable` HTML attribute for the entire document body.
